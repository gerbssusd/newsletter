<h1>Universal Design for Learning: Barrier-free education for everyone</h1>
<hr>
<p>
    Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is a framework that helps teachers plan and design learning encounters for all people. UDL assumes that any effort to provide struggling individual learners with better access to knowledge benefits ALL learners. UDL supports social constructivism theories by allowing additional learners access that expands the language and discussion surrounding a given topic. In this way, UDL may increase student acquisition of knowledge as well as expand the knowledge base surrounding any given topic.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
    UDL guidelines seek to increase student access to learning through the enhancement of three areas:&nbsp; engagement, representation, and action and expression. Providing students with multiple means of performing each of these learning actions provides them with additional means of accessing, building, and internalizing knowledge. These strategies can help students achieve the goal of becoming expert learners who are purposeful and motivated, resourceful and knowledgeable, and strategic and goal-oriented.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
    &nbsp;UDL guidelines encourage multiple means of engagement that develop affective networks, or the “why” of learning.&nbsp; Teachers may provide students greater access to learning with options that recruit student interest.&nbsp; Once students access information, engagement that builds student learning supports options that sustain effort and persistence.&nbsp; Options for self-regulation provide students with additional pathways to internalize knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    Multiple means of representation of ideas help students develop recognition networks or the “what” of learning.&nbsp; Options for perception or understanding provide students with multiple avenues to access information.&nbsp; Language and symbol options facilitate students as they build knowledge, and options surrounding student comprehension encourage student internalization.
</p>
<p>
    Additional avenues of Action and Expression encourage student strategic networks, or the “how” of learning.&nbsp; UDL suggests physical action options can to enhance student access as they engage with learning tasks.&nbsp; Options for expression and communication provide students with additional pathways to build ideas, and options for executive functions such as goal setting and planning and development help students internalize new concepts.&nbsp;&nbsp;

    Teachers who incorporate UDL guidelines into their curriculum flow provide ALL learners with additional access to learning.
